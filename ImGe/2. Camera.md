# Camera

# Field of View

> Opening angle
- common game setting ~50° opening angle

> Aspect ratio
- Example: 4:3 -> 16:9 
	- one sees less bc the opening angle stays the same -> but top and bottom get cut away
- -> diff people diff setup see diff things

> Physical screens
- approx opening angle of common desktop setup ~40°
- common game setting ~50°
	- game is slightly distorted
	- view on virtual world is shrunk
	- parallax distortion (obj further away appear to move slower)
	- usually negligible distortion, still could lead to motion sickness

> Wayfinding
- small FOV may inhibit wayfinding of player bc one sees less & has to move cam more
- larger FOV helps player understand spatial relationships

> Field of regard
- describes ==total observable area== that a sensor or imaging sys can cover by moving or steering its FOV
- e.g. in some games can't look up directly
- FOR >= FOV

## Lens & Optics
- play crucial part for the overall feel and cinematography of game
- lens params in virtual cameras also define ==visual style, scale== and ==emotional impact== in gameplay and cutscenes (not just technical)
- simulating camera ==imperfection== in game engines is very hard!
	- e.g. games on unreal engine all look the same -> camera is too perfect

> Focal Length
- Controls magnification and field of view

> Aperture (f-stop)
- Affects exposure and depth of field

> Focus distance


-> Case study: cinematography of Star Wars Outlaws
-> Bokeh chart

# Relationship: Travel and Camera Control
- user interaction is between the world (i.e. the objects) and the player
	- player is divided into the character (i.e. the avatar) and the camera (i.e. the player's view)

- Three distinct 
- for 3D space: 6 degrees of freedom



# Game view
- positions of cam, audio listener, type of camera and control scheme affect POV from which player perceives a gamespace
- design of entire game space depending on camera settings

## Independent view
- camera is unrelated to the person -> Exo-centric view control
- mostly used in 2D: Fixed view + Automatically or interactively adjusted view
- e.g. city-builder, league, civ, baldur's gate
	- although in some cases cam is not absolutely independent, e.g. following characters sometimes

## Fixed view

> Top view (bird)


> Front view

> Slanted view

- sometimes allowed to jump between different fixed views

> Single-screen view

### System Complexity


## First-person view
- cam placed at "head" of the player
	- but not really, could look weird depending on FOV etc
- camera post has the same pos and orientation as the character pose

> Challenges in making shooter games
- models for other players != model of your own body parts 
	- -> 1st person models of Overwatch
- running against a wall in a shooter
	- -> model for oneself is very small but put very near in front of the cam

### System complexity

> [!warning] Terms
> Presence
> Immersion

- Limited view -> compensation
	- audio -> e.g. can hear steps even if you don't see the enemy
	- map design -> player able to clear corners individually at a junction

### Control schemes



## Third person view
- different modes with diff control schemes that could switch automatically
	- bc sometimes diff modes are needed to e.g. help player better gain info, spacial awareness etc.
	- z.B. when doing different actions such as normal running, climbing, zipline
	- Challenges
		- input method/scheme also could change completely -> how to make player comfortable with switching? 
		- transitions very hard to implement (well)

- -> case study: Elden Ring 
	- First entrance into Limgrave
		- cam will show the entirety of limgrave no matter what, bc player will go through the door and cam will follow and it only has "one" path to go
		- -> clearly shows goals/next steps in the game
	- when riding, cam flattens slightly and zooms out -> increase FOV to let players take in the world and set next goal

## Mixed Views

- "raus zoomen" von 1st into 3rd/independent -> man sieht direkt wo man selber ist
