> How do we perceive depth on flat displays?

## Human Vision & Oculomotor cues

> Accommodation
- human vision is sharpest in central part of visual field (fovea), becomes more blurry towares the periphery
- to see sharp images, the lens in the eye changes shape in order to let light from "every" angle hit the fovea

> Convergence
- Eyeballs tilt inwards in order to see details of the obj

> Stereopsis
- seeing in stereo (by two sensors/eyes)
- leads to *disparity* -- difference in image location between left and right eye

> Angular Size 
- is the angle an object occupies on the retina 
- depends on the obj's actual size and distance from the observer
	- distance increase -> angular size decrease
- Familiar obj (like humans or cars) help us judge distance and depth using perceived size

## To make humans perceive depth

> Stereo Display
- show two images on screen on purpose to make human see two different images, as one would when looking at something in the distance 
- faked distance of the shown scene on screen != actual distance of screen 
	- -> accommodation-convergence mismatch
	- could cause motion sickness

> Monocular, Static cues
- Relative size
- Height relative to the horizon
- Occlusion
- Linear perspective
- Aerial perspective (atmospheric attenuation - things appear less saturated & blue in the distance)
- Shadows, lighting
- Texture gradient
- Depth of Focus

> Motion Parallax
- Stationary motion parallax: Obj move relative to stationary viewer
- Moving-viewer motion parallax: viewer moves relative to stationary obj
- Hybrid motions: obj and viewer move

- Close obj move faster across visual field than distant obj
	- -> Dynamic depth cue

# Case Study: Disneyland's use of forced perspective 

> Houses on main street 
- ![[Pasted image 20251105105526.png|425]]
- make upper stories appear even more distant (and so the house taller) by reducing their sizes

> Castle
- wide, life-sized base, thin towers -> towers appear taller
- no elements on the outside that let you deduce amount of stories
- taller -> colours get paler

> Tower of Terror
- fixed viewpoint from elevator
- hallway is more narrow at the end
- ![[Pasted image 20251105111404.png|425]]

> Cars land
- paint rocks that need to be further away in less saturated
