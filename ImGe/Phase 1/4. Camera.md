- translates game into 2D visual representation on screen

> Shaping the player's experience with
- Position, Angle
	- What the player sees
	- e.g. vast landscape or small room
- Perspective, FOV, Depth of field
	- stylisation of perceived scene
- Movement/lack of
	- following character(s) / remain static / move freely
	- impacts how player interacts with the environment


# Field of View
- extent of the game world visible on the screen at any given time
- measured as an angle
	- can be horizontal, vertical of diagonal, depending on game engine
- together with ==aspect ratio==, creates ==view frustrum== 

> Field of regard
- represents ==total observable area== that a sensor or imaging sys can cover by moving or steering its FOV
- defines ==maximum coverage area== achievable by the sys
	- e.g. in some games can't look up directly
- FOR >= FOV

## Influenced by 

> Opening angle
- common game setting horizontal 50°-60° opening angle seems "natural"
- smaller FOV generatres zooming effect and a "tunneled" view
- larger FOV distorts view

> Aspect ratio
- Example transition from 4:3 -> 16:9 
	- one sees less bc the opening angle stays the same -> but top and bottom get cut away

> Physical screens
- common desktop setting
	- measuring from eye-screen distance -> ~40° horizontal FOV
- common game setting ~50°
	- game is slightly distorted 
	- view on virtual world is shrunk
	- parallax distortion (obj further away appear to move slower)
	- usually negligible distortion, still could lead to motion sickness

## Influences

> Wayfinding
- small FOV may inhibit wayfinding of player bc player sees less & has to move cam more
- larger FOV helps player understand spatial relationships

> Player experience
- larger FOV in shooter games considered cheating
- larger FOV may cause nausea/cybersickness

# Lens & Optics
- play crucial part for the overall feel and cinematography of game
- lens params in virtual cameras also define ==visual style, scale== and ==emotional impact== in gameplay and cutscenes (not just technical)
- simulating camera ==imperfection== in game engines is very hard!
	- e.g. games on unreal engine all look the same bc camera is too perfect and wrong settings

> Focal Length
- Controls magnification and field of view

> Aperture (f-stop)
- Affects exposure and depth of field

> Focus distance
- Determines which part of the scene appears sharp

> Imperfections
- simulate real lens imperfections for realism and cinematic feel
- abberation, vignetting, bokeh shape, distortion, reflections, dirt, flares, bloom, ...

> [!example] Case study: cinematography of Star Wars Outlaws
> For which cinematography of the movies were analysed
> - bokeh chart, lens examples
> - composition
