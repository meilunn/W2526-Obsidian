- user interaction is between the *world* (i.e. the objects) and the *player*
	- player is divided into the character (i.e. the avatar) and the camera (i.e. the player's view)
	- ![[Pasted image 20251029105550.png|325]]

- Three distinct *spacial relationships (SRs)* between
	- world and character
		- depending on object manipulation (world) and travel (character)
	- world and camera
		- objects (world) and image (bird's eye, map, ...)
	- character and camera
		- 1st/3rd person, ...

	- each relationship has 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) per SR -> two SRs completely define the third
		- position $(p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z})$
		- orientation $(o_{x}, o_{y}, o_{z})$

> By interacting, the player can change the SRs

## Issues to Consider when implementing cam control
- System Complexity
	- 2D vs 3D
- Interaction Control Schemes
	- Fixed vs automatic vs interactive
	- Position vs rate control
	- Hybrid, multiple views -> Minimaps
- UI options/implementations of diff platforms
