## The first steps
- as seen in most examples, <u>camera control and player control</u> are some of the first things to be fully implemented
	- camera, player model, player animations, mechanics are basically finished
- use comments in game prototype 
	- labelling things
	- communicate goal of certain parts throughout dev team

- Example: Sniper elite
	- guns already have detailed model bc they're objective, important for establishing shot at start of mission 
	- -> need to know how they look like for the player from all angles/possibilities
	- Able to deduce scale of obj
		- Texturen mit karo Muster 
			- beliebiger aber festgelegter unit
			- verschiedene karo texturen für verschiedene Sachen (z.B. Materialien)
		- Charaktere in die scene reinstellen

# Blockout
- aka grayboxing/whiteboxing

- create ==simplified version== of level using ==basic shapes n forms==
	- primitives 
- all things created e.g. in probuilder will NOT be in the final game

### Purposes
1. Establish spatial layout
	- help define size, scale, and distribution of spaces within level
	- allow designers to plan pathways, zones, key POI
2. Test gameplay mechanics
	- test movement, line of sight, combat dynamics, interaction with environment
	- ensure level plays well n feels engaging
3. Iterate Rapidly
	- blockouts can be easily modified based on feedback or new ideas
	- no need to redo complex art assets -> saves time n resources
4. Communication Tool
	- visual n spacial communication tool among dev team members (game designers, artists, programmers)
	- align team on level's design and gameplay intentions
		- -> comments/labels


# Spatial Prototyping Process
## Distinct phases
### 1. Conceptualisation
1. Develop an idea
	- Narrative, rough Story
	- Place in game world where the game is set
	- Art direction, general artistic vision
	- Gameplay: core gameplay of the space
2. Research
	- find related games, play and analyse
	- asset list analysis
	- create **reference/mood board**
3. Understand what you want to create
	- understand the context of the gamespace you are creating (purpose of place, story, etc)
	- collect/write design statements, define **goals of your creation**
	- collect first impressions with reference/mood boards
	- draw some sketches to document artistic vision -> concept art
4. Synchronise vision
	- documentation/notes!
	- make schedules -> be realistic

> Output
- high-level concept of gamespace
- high concept statement
- 30s of gameplay
- reference/mood board
- concept art

### 2. Plan
1. Create formal description of gamespace
	- plan out spacial relationships of gamespace on abstract level, how it will be experienced by player
	- create diagrams & flowcharts to indicate relationships 
	- Things to consider are
		- Layout -> relevant design principles
		- Identity -> mood, colour scheme, environment itself, composition, environmental storytelling, story events, gameplay events etc
	- ![[Pasted image 20251120111709.png|375]]
2. optionally create non-digital prototypes
	- build a map/space out of paper, lego etc is fast and cheap
	- first impression
3. massing
	- get a sense of space
	- plan and evaluate for each node in formal gamespace plan
	- develop understanding of proportions, approx sizes and layout of spaces
	- place basic blocks and shapes in game engine to determine whether the planned configuration is practical and aesthetically viable
4. draw a map
	- not final
	- roughly covers entire level -> detailed version of bubble diagramm
	- include planned combat encounters, plarforming sections etc
		- indicate amount of enemies 
		- notes on what the situation will look like for the player

### 3. Design blockout
1. First blockout
	- place big blocks and meshes to **get a sense of space in level** -> quick and dirty
	- not exact, but try to stick to rough scale as on the map and metrics you already have
	- spot potential issues for level
2. Camera n Scale
	- fixate cam n scale of game/level
	- very expensive to change later
3. Iterate on the concept
	- blockout level using drawn map
	- test
	- adjust map, make it more accurate
	- repeat
	- -> get feedback early & often
4. Add key aesthetics
	- 

----
- Iterative process!
	- Documenting n Playtesting are essential!
		- also record unsuccessful outcomes to avoid repetion of mistakes
	- process is flexible -> allows for revisiting any previous phase or step as needed to refine prototype
		- may be beneficial to project's development

> Also might be a good idea to explore possibilities with quick n dirty prototypes before heading into structured process


Bewegung/Pfad vom Character kontrollieren -> kamera einstellen für gute shots

Pfad anpassen auf Dialog/Story elemente die in der Szene passieren

Obj essential to player experience needed in prototype

design blockouts by game/level degisners
art blockout by environment artists & game/level designers with art focus

one button pipeline
	automisation of production process
	tools
create asset kits to optimise for e.g. console hardware 


----
high concept statement

bottleneck is transporting data -> use as few materials as possible -> asset kits
