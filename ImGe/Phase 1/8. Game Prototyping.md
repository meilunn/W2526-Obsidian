## The first steps
- as seen in most examples, <u>camera control and player control</u> are some of the first things to be fully implemented
	- camera, player model, player animations, mechanics are basically finished
- use comments in game prototype 
	- labelling things
	- communicate goal of certain parts throughout dev team

- Example: Sniper elite
	- guns already have detailed model bc they're objective, important for establishing shot at start of mission 
	- -> need to know how they look like for the player from all angles/possibilities
	- Able to deduce scale of obj
		- Texturen mit karo Muster 
			- beliebiger aber festgelegter unit
			- verschiedene karo texturen für verschiedene Sachen (z.B. Materialien)
		- Charaktere in die scene reinstellen

# Blockout
- aka grayboxing/whiteboxing

- create ==simplified version== of level using ==basic shapes n forms==
	- primitives 
- all things created e.g. in probuilder will NOT be in the final game

### Purposes
1. Establish spatial layout
	- help define size, scale, and distribution of spaces within level
	- allow designers to plan pathways, zones, key POI
2. Test gameplay mechanics
	- test movement, line of sight, combat dynamics, interaction with environment
	- ensure level plays well n feels engaging
3. Iterate Rapidly
	- blockouts can be easily modified based on feedback or new ideas
	- no need to redo complex art assets -> saves time n resources
4. Communication Tool
	- visual n spacial communication tool among dev team members (game designers, artists, programmers)
	- align team on level's design and gameplay intentions
		- -> comments/labels


# Spatial Prototyping Process
- Distinct phases
	1. Conceptualisation
		- Develop an idea
		- Research
		- Understand what you want to create
	2. Plan
		- Create formal description of gamespace
		- optionally create non-digital prototypes
		- massing
		- draw a map
	3. Design blockout
		- First blockout
		- Camera n Scale
		- Iterate on the concept
		- Start with the Blockout Cycle
		- 
- Iterative process!
	- Documenting n Playtesting are essential!
		- also record unsuccessful outcomes to avoid repetion of mistakes
	- process is flexible -> allows for revisiting any previous phase or step as needed to refine prototype
		- may be beneficial to project's development

> Also might be a good idea to explore possibilities with quick n dirty prototypes before heading into structured process


Bewegung/Pfad vom Character kontrollieren -> kamera einstellen für gute shots

Pfad anpassen auf Dialog/Story elemente die in der Szene passieren

Obj essential to player experience needed in prototype

design blockouts by game/level degisners
art blockout by environment artists & game/level designers with art focus

one button pipeline
	automisation of production process
	tools
create asset kits to optimise for e.g. console hardware 


----
high concept statement

bottleneck is transporting data -> use as few materials as possible -> asset kits
