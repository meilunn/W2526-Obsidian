#### Monitors
- monocular depth cues
	- visual clues that allow perception of depth and distance using only one eye
- stereoscopic depth cues (should be >= 100 Hz)
	- active glasses ("shutter glasses")
	- passive glasses
	- spectral multiplexing (anaglyphic stereo)
	- polarasation multiplexing
- "Fishtank VR"
	- required head tracking 

#### Auto Stereoscopic Displays
- No shutter glasses
- Lenitcular: Vertical grating in front of the display screen
- Holographic: Reproduction of the properties of light waves

#### Tablets and Phones
- sometimes autostereoscopic
- retina display (Apple)
	- High pixel density (326 ppi) -> eye cannot distiguish individual pixels
	- minimally focusable distance <-> typical viewing distance

#### Heads-up Displays (HUDs)
- "keep your head up"
- for non-game related as well

#### Head-Mounted VR Displays (HMDs)
- Hands-free full (360°) Field of Regard
- Individual active viewpoints for each eye
- Challenges
	- FOV and Resolution getting better
	- Unknown individual interocular distance
	- Disparity of sensed motion cues
	- May get uncomfortable
	- VR vs AR
	- New relevant direction in gaming? 

#### Head-Mounted AR Displays
- Optical see-through
- Video see-through
- Small FOV (30-60°)

#### "Arm-"Mounted Displays (tracked AR, VR)
- often tablets or mobile phones
- Full 360° field of regard
- often implemented as a window into the virtual or augmented world
- e.g. pokemon go -> phone is arm mounted

#### Surround-Screen Displays (CAVEs)
- 3-6 big projection displays 
- typically rear-projected

> [!info] Cybersickness
> Cybersickness is akin to motion sickness, but it happens while using electronic screens rather than through actual movement.

#### Large Projection Walls
- Workbenches
	- 2 Display surfaces
	- L-shaped
	- Stereoscopic
	- Motion parallax (limited mobility)
- Hemispherical Displays
	- 180° FOV
	- Spherical Projection
	- Front-projected (brighter)
