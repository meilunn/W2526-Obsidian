# Wayfinding Techniques
- wayfinding techniques support player in advancing from landmark knowledge to survey knowledge
- challange: go up a mountain -> travel becomes primary mechanic -> cues become clues, challenge itself is to be able to read a provided map
- keep cognitive load for cues low -> player unaware of its existence/doings

# User centered wayfinding cues
FOV
- small fov -> more cam movement -> more cognitive load understanding cam movement


Proprioception
- z.B. nur durch Bewegung können wir auch wissen, wo wir räumlich sind
- Hemmt Gefühl von Presence, führt dazu dass körper verwirrt ist (vor allem in VR) -> körper hat sich nicht bewegt, aber im Spiel schon


Search strategy
- obtaining bird's eye view in games
	- map
	- or climbing on something tall like towers (e.g. assassin's creed even reveals map/locations)
		- player WILL climb towers bc they learned already that towers = map knowledge -> established pattern
		- -> will probably not work for new players -> tell them somehow! 
- often players will try to search naively, get frustrated, and only then apply search pattern -> shape this experience through game design and playtesting 

# Environment-Centered 

> Important bc user centered cues are so limited

## Natural Cues



## Artificial Cues



level design patterns based on programming patterns based on Book by Alexander, Ishikawa, Silverstein
- though critisised for not acknowledging that usage of a certain pattern depends on the situation
