Goal: Help player establish spatial knowledge so that they can use primed target-based search

# Wayfinding Techniques
- wayfinding techniques support player in advancing from landmark knowledge to survey knowledge
- challange: go up a mountain -> travel becomes primary mechanic -> cues become clues, challenge itself is to be able to read a provided map
- keep cognitive load for cues low -> player unaware of its existence/doings

# User centered wayfinding cues
FOV
- small fov -> more cam movement -> more cognitive load understanding cam movement


Proprioception
- z.B. nur durch Bewegung können wir auch wissen, wo wir räumlich sind
- Hemmt Gefühl von Presence, führt dazu dass körper verwirrt ist (vor allem in VR) -> körper hat sich nicht bewegt, aber im Spiel schon


Search strategy
- obtaining bird's eye view in games
	- map
	- or climbing on something tall like towers (e.g. assassin's creed even reveals map/locations)
		- player WILL climb towers bc they learned already that towers = map knowledge -> established pattern
		- -> will probably not work for new players -> tell them somehow! 
- often players will try to search naively, get frustrated, and only then apply search pattern -> shape this experience through game design and playtesting 

# Environment-Centered 

> Important bc user centered cues are so limited

## Natural Cues

A Pattern Language:
- level design patterns based on programming patterns based on Book by Alexander, Ishikawa, Silverstein
- though critisised for not acknowledging that usage of a certain pattern depends on the situation

### Legibility techniques
The Image of the City - Lynch
- Urban design principles
- 5 basic building blocks

> Paths
- linear movement means only forwards or backwards

> Edges
- 

> Districs
- The Witness
	- -> video analysis essays

- having individual districs help player establish mental map 
	- use districs as unit instead of every single little thing
	- helps player to orientate themselves in the game world
- different aesthetics bring variety -> makes game cooler/more interesting
- different mechanics, challenges (e.g. enemy types) in every area
- influence pacing of game
- -> when planning a game, think in districts! 
- 2D concept -> elevation is neglectable when e.g. talking about map of districs

> Nodes
- Gathering points, intersection points of paths
- Often places of importance 
	- e.g. city
- paths, districs, landmarks, edges IN nodes -> hierarchy
- zentrale ausgangspunkte für Orientierung
- player will often stay here for longer

> Landmarks
- Function is external, player doesn't necessarily enter them
- Multiple landmarks in relation to each other also help player establish spatial knowledge 
	- e.g. is between landmark a and b
- Global landmarks
	- visible from practically any location
	- provide directional/orientation cues
- Local landmarks
	- provide useful information when decision point is reached
		- e.g. small statue at fork in path
		- -> player will recognise that they have been here before
- can be used to mark short/middle/long term goals

### Real-world design principles
- obstacles -> people will avoid


### Challenge: Overestimating Guidance
- designers sometimes overestimate how effective guiding elements are

## Artificial Cues

Maps
- projections that have errors (e.g. spherical surface of globe onto map on paper)
- model of the environment
- sonne kommt normalisiert immer von links oben
- communicate structure of world to player

Compass bar
- doesn't show elevation
	- e.g. objective is inside mountain
