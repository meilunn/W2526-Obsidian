# Classification
## Travel Tasks
- Three types needed/used distinguished by user's goal

> Exploration
- environment is *unknown to the player*
- environment needs to be explored to *gain spacial knowledge*
- player has *no explicit goal*

- often at beginning of game or when new environment is reached
- movement cannot be predicted
- UI Requirements
	- allow for continuous, direct control of the viewpoint
	- interruption of animated viewpoint control
	- little cognitive load on user on understanding technique used to travel

> Search
- travelling to a *specific goal of target location* within new environment
- Two ways for players to search
	- <u>Naive target-based search</u>: 
		- player acquiring additional spatial knowledge while searching
		- exploring the environment until objective is found
	- <u>Primed target-based search</u>: 
		- player uses *pre-existing* spacial knowledge to find goal
- goal oriented UI
	- let player specify destination on a map (-> given that destination is shown on map)
	- show direction toward goal or complete route either in world or on map

> Maneuvering
- *small, precise movements* in small area -> boss fights, jump n run
- includes repositioning local viewpoint
- can cost players lots of time and cause major frustrations (independent of an adequate implementation)
- UI requirements
	- Great precision of motion
	- very fast
	- tight feedback look

### Characterisation of travel tasks
- usually a secondary task -> technique needs to be <u>unobtrusive, intuitive and easily controlled</u>
- multiple factors taken into account to characterise travel tasks

> Distance to be traveled
- Short-range -> requires high precision
- Medium-range
- Long-range -> can be realised with velocity control or teleportation

> Amount of curvature or number of turns in the path
- Little -> Steering-based on torso-direction
- Much -> Pointing-based travel

> Visibility of target from starting location
- if target is visible, gaze-based techniques can be used

> Number of DoFs required for the movement
- Motion in a horizontal plane (driving, walking)
- Motion in 3D (flying, parkouring)

> Required accuracy of movement
- High accuracy requires a technique that allows for
	- fine control of direction, speed, and targeting location 
	- easy error recovery
- Medium/Low accuracy -> Map-based techniques

## Isomorphic Travel
- one-to-one mapping of input to output
- Special variations
	- target selection
		- target is selected via one-to-one mapping 
		- travel mode *f* along path is determined by system
	- fast travel/teleportation 

### Principles

> Pose of input device
- Absolute (direct) pose
	- input mapped "one-to-one" to the new position
- Relative (indirect) pose
	- input is transformed into the new position relative to a starting point of the input device and its local coord sys
- ![[Pasted image 20251105115603.png|183]]

> Input frequency
- influences sys behaviour
- Once (e.g. button click) -> sys can jump to new pose
- Repeated (e.g. dragged mouse) -> sys follows path indicated by user

> Target Selection
- interaction method to select target can vary
- via picking on the screen (e.g. in a map, in 3D environment)
- via picking item on a list (e.g. in GUI, via speech)

> Mathematical concept 
- $\text{new pose} = \text{computer input}$
- or $\text{new pose} = f(\text{user interaction})$

> Variations
- Conversion: user input -> new 3D pose
- Direct jump (e.g. teleportation)
- Animation
	- Speed (fixed or dynamic) 
	- Travel path (direct path/flight or with obstacles/waypoint)




> [!info] Isomorphic vs Non-isomorphic - Key difference
> Isomorphic control is a **one-to-one mapping** of input to output
> Non-isomorphic uses some **scaled linear/non-linear mapping**
